# Notes
The underlying technologies behind computers and networks have many flaws. 
- There are fundamental flaws in the design and implementation of the underlying operating systems, applications and protocols.

For every offensive technique discussed, we'll also analyze their defensive counterpart

Insider threats are the origin point for a majority of attacks examples include:
- Disgruntled employees
- Clueless employees
- Customers
- Suppliers
- Vendors 
- Business partners
- Contractors, temps and Consultants

## Setting up a Home Lab
- Set up two or three machines on an isolated LAN segment, with completely fresh operating systems
- Make sure there is absolutely no sensitive information on the hard drives
- Link the systems together with an inexpensive hub or switch, which you can purchase for less than $50 at most computer stores
- To maximize the flexibility of our lab,  create dual-boot systems, installing operating systems such as Linux, Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/2003, OpenBDS, or Solaris x86.
- Might be better to virtualize the entire thing 

Even though a given tool described in this book runs on a given platform, the exact same techniques can be applied to attack other types of platforms. Likewise, the same types of defenses should also be applied to all systems to prevent attacks

# Summary 
As society grows with a greater a data-centric focus, attacks will become more prevalent and damaging.

We are in a golden age of hacking and we need to understand attackers' techniques and strategies

Attacks come from all walks of life so it is necessary to not underestimate threats just because of a lack of experience

To experiment with the tools described in this book, run them on systems without valuable data, physically separated from your production network. 
- Setup a small evaluation lab of two or three machines.
